# ADR-006 — Deploy trigger model: idempotent reconcile + pull loop

**Decided:** 2026-07-21
The deploy unit is a single **idempotent, state-driven verb** (`cairn reconcile` /
`cairn deploy`): read desired ref → compare to running → converge only if different;
running it twice is a no-op. Triggers are pluggable pokes at that verb.

**Default trigger:** a **pull-based loop** (systemd timer) on the VPS that reads a
desired-state pointer and converges. Reaches only *outward*; no inbound ports; self-
heals across missed events.

**Deferred:** a bespoke webhook daemon is a later luxury, not Phase 1. Because the
verb is idempotent, adding a webhook receiver later just calls the same verb.
(CI-over-SSH push is rejected per ADR-005.)
